# Address Book Web Application (JSP-Servlet)

Welcome to the **Address Book Web Application** repository! This project demonstrates a seamless implementation of a dynamic web application built using **JSP (JavaServer Pages)**, **Servlets**, and **JDBC** to manage user contacts. The application provides an intuitive and secure interface for users to organize their contact details, showcasing modern web development concepts, clean code practices, and seamless backend integration.

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

The Address Book application allows users to:

- **Register** and **log in** securely to access their contact list.
- **Add**, **view**, **edit**, and **delete** contacts, including details like name, phone number, email, relation, date of birth, and address.
- Categorize contacts by **relation** (Relatives, Family, Friends, Colleagues, Neighbors) for better organization.
- Assign **address type** (Home, Work, etc.) and mark important contacts as favorites.
- Automatically track and display **birthdays**.
- Utilize **session management** to ensure only logged-in users can access or modify their contacts.
- Interface with a **relational database** via **JDBC** to store and manage user data persistently.

The design is responsive and user-friendly, built with **Bootstrap** to ensure a modern, mobile-friendly experience across all devices.

## üí° Skills and Concepts Implemented

This project highlights the use of several important technologies and concepts:

### 1. **JSP & Servlets (Java EE)**
   - **JSP (JavaServer Pages)**: Used for generating dynamic HTML pages that create a seamless user experience by embedding Java code into HTML.
   - **Servlets**: Responsible for handling HTTP requests and processing business logic for user actions, such as logging in and managing contacts.

### 2. **Database Integration with JDBC**
   - The application is integrated with a **MySQL database** using **JDBC** to store user and contact data persistently.
   - **Prepared Statements** ensure secure interactions with the database to prevent SQL injection and maintain performance.

### 3. **User Authentication and Session Management**
   - User authentication is implemented, with secure login and registration functionality.
   - **HttpSession** is used for session management, ensuring that only authenticated users can access or modify their contacts.

### 4. **Responsive Web Design**
   - The frontend is designed using **Bootstrap**, ensuring the application is responsive and user-friendly across a variety of devices, including mobile and desktop.

### 5. **Clean Code & MVC Architecture**
   - The project follows **clean code** principles, with modular, maintainable code.
   - The **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** architecture is used to separate business logic, data, and user interface for improved code maintainability.

## ‚ú® Future Enhancements

While this is a fully functional application, there are several potential enhancements to consider for the future:

- **Search Functionality**: Add a feature to search contacts by name, phone number, or email.
- **User Profile Management**: Enable users to update their profile information such as email, password, or profile picture.
- **Secure Password Storage**: Implement password hashing (e.g., bcrypt) to prevent storing plain-text passwords and enhance user data security.
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Add an extra verification step via email or SMS for improved account protection.
- **Import/Export Contacts**: Enable CSV/Excel import and export for easy contact migration.
